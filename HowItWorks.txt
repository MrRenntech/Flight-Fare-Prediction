# Flight Fare Prediction - The Complete Guide

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a high-performance Machine Learning application designed to predict the price of flight tickets in India. It leverages a **Random Forest Regressor** to analyze historical patterns and deliver accurate fare estimates.

**Design Philosophy**: Inspired by American automotive excellence (Chevy USA), the interface features bold gold (#FFC72C) and black colors, representing power, precision, and American performance.

The system is built on:
-   **Python 3.14**: Core logic with comprehensive inline comments and docstrings
-   **Flask**: Web server and API (fully documented)
-   **Scikit-Learn**: Machine Learning engine with detailed preprocessing pipeline
-   **HTML5/CSS3**: Bold, professional user interface
-   **Batch Scripts**: Commented installation and launch utilities

### Code Documentation
Every file in this project contains extensive inline comments explaining:
-   **What**: What the code does
-   **Why**: Why it's implemented this way
-   **How**: How it works technically

This makes the codebase ideal for learning Machine Learning and web development.

## 2. Features & Inputs

To get an accurate prediction, the model requires specific details about the flight. Here is what each input field represents:

### Departure Date & Time
-   **What it is**: The exact moment the plane leaves the gate.
-   **Why it matters**: 
    -   Flights at odd hours (e.g., 2 AM) are often cheaper.
    -   Flights on weekends or holidays are usually more expensive.
-   **Processing**: The system splits this into `Journey_day`, `Journey_month`, `Dep_hour`, and `Dep_min`.

### Arrival Date & Time
-   **What it is**: When the plane reaches the destination.
-   **Why it matters**: Used to calculate the total **Duration** of the flight. Longer flights consume more fuel and crew time, typically costing more.

### Source & Destination
-   **Source**: Where the flight originates (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai).
-   **Destination**: Where the flight lands (e.g., Cochin, Hyderabad).
-   **Impact**: Certain routes (like Delhi to Mumbai) are high-traffic and competitive, affecting prices. Distance is also a key factor.
-   **Technical**: These are "One-Hot Encoded" internally (converted to mathematical vectors).

### Total Stops
-   **Options**: Non-Stop, 1 Stop, 2 Stops, etc.
-   **Impact**: Non-stop flights are premium products and often cost more. However, very long flights with many stops can also be expensive due to airport taxes.

### Airline Preference
-   **Options**: Jet Airways, Indigo, Air India, etc.
-   **Impact**: 
    -   **Budget Carriers** (IndiGo, SpiceJet): Generally cheaper.
    -   **Full Service** (Air India, Jet Airways): Generally more expensive, especially "Business" class.

## 3. How It Works (Under the Hood)

### The Brain: Random Forest Regressor
The "Brain" of this application is an algorithm called **Random Forest**.
1.  **Decision Trees**: Imagine asking 100 experts to estimate the price. One expert focuses on the Airline, another on the Duration, another on the Month.
2.  **Ensemble**: The Random Forest averages the opinions of these 100 "trees" to eliminate bias and reduce errors.
3.  **Result**: A highly robust prediction that isn't easily fooled by outliers.

### The Flow
1.  **User Input**: You fill the form on the website.
2.  **Transmission**: Browser sends data to `main.py` via a POST request.
3.  **Preprocessing**: 
    -   Dates are converted to numbers.
    -   Text (like "Delhi") is matched against the trained model's columns (`columns.json`).
4.  **Prediction**: The data is fed into `flight_rf.pkl`.
5.  **Response**: The price is calculated, rounded, and sent back to display.

## 4. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### "TemplateNotFound: home.html"
-   **Cause**: Flask cannot find the HTML file.
-   **Fix**: Ensure `home.html` is inside a folder named `templates` in the project root.

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
-   **Cause**: Missing libraries.
-   **Fix**: Run `install_prereq.bat` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### "The price seems too high/low"
-   **Reason**: The model was trained on data from **2019**. Prices have changed significantly since then due to inflation, fuel costs, and airline bankruptcies (e.g., Jet Airways).
-   **Solution**: Retrain the model with 2024/2025 data if available.

### Dataset Information & Updates
-   **Current Dataset**: The model uses data from 2019 covering major Indian routes.
-   **Latest Public Data**: As of December 2024, the most recent publicly available Indian flight fare dataset is from August 2023 (scraped from MakeMyTrip), available on Kaggle.
-   **Why Not Updated**: Real-time flight pricing data is proprietary and not freely available. Public datasets lag by 1-2 years.
-   **For Production Use**: Consider integrating with live APIs from booking platforms (e.g., Skyscanner API, Amadeus API) for real-time predictions.
